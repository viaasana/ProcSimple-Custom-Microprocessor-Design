# ProcSimple-Custom-Microprocessor-Design
This lab involves building a simplified processor architecture, including core components such as the Program Counter (PC), Instruction Register (IR), ALU, Register File, Control Unit, and supporting logic. The processor executes a custom instruction set and simulates instruction execution via waveform verification.
